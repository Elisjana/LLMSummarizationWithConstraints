It specifically identifies connections where a person expresses interest in a tag and the post or forum has that tag as well.

The information flow could be disrupted, leading to inaccuracies and potential problems with query optimization. For example: If a user posts without showing interest in any tags on the forum, it will not generate the expected relationship structure from the defined constraints."}
